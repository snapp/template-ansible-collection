# Cookiecutter Template: â’¶ Ansible Collection

This project provides an opinionated template for bootstrapping an Ansible Collection that extends the minimal structure provided by ``ansible galaxy collection init``.

By leveraging ``cookiecutter`` you will be asked a small number of questions (e.g., namespace, collection name, etc.) which will then be automatically applied to the resulting directory structure.

> **_NOTE:_** This template draws inspiration from the [Ansible Community GitHub Collection Template](https://github.com/ansible-collections/collection_template).

## Requirements

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

## Using this template

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/snapp/template-ansible-collection
```
