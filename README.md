This project provides an opinionated template for bootstrapping an Ansible Collection that extends the minimal structure provided by `ansible galaxy collection init`.

By leveraging [cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io) you will be asked a small number of questions (e.g., namespace, collection name, etc.) which will then be automatically applied to the resulting directory structure.

> [!NOTE]
> This template draws inspiration from the [Ansible Community GitHub Collection Template](https://github.com/ansible-collections/collection_template).

## Requirements

```console
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

## Using this template

```console
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/snapp/template-ansible-collection
```

### Overriding template defaults

Cookiecutter provides a few options for specifying user configurations which can be used to override the template default question values.

Creating a `.cookiecutterrc` file in your home directory is the easiest way to specify a user configuration, but you can also pass a config file in at runtime using the `--config-file` option.

> [!NOTE]
> cookiecutter configuration files are formatted in YAML syntax

**Example:**
```yaml
---
default_context:
  author: "snapp@example.com"
  namespace: "snapp"
```

See the [Advanced Usage / User Config](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/user_config.html) documentation for more information.
